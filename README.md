# Serial Monitor Using Tauri
### About
For this project I wanted to make a serial monitor with tauri because of its corss platform application building. I can make a native application using a front end in Nextjs and a back end in rust.

### Setup
Install all the dependancies for rust and the website then you can run cargo run dev to start the application.

### Release
Check the releases for a downloadable application for you OS!
